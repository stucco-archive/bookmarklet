[Oak Ridge National Laboratory](http://www.ornl.gov/) is leading a research project for the [Department of Homeland Security Cyber Security Division](http://www.cyber.st.dhs.gov/).
As part of the project **we are building a cyber security knowledge graph** to facilitate analyzing security events and incident handling.
Part of the data used to build the knowledge graph will be blog posts, news stories, and other online information.

We are collecting anonymous data that will help us label security information that will be used in extracting information into the knowledge graph. 
We reason that if a piece of information is relevant to you, then it may be relevant to another analyst. 
To make this possible, we have made a bookmarklet that we'd like you to click when you find an interesting security article.

This sends the url along with a short form (and your optional anonymous hash) to us that we will then use to build models to automatically parse and prioritize security information.

As usual, we're making these tools [open source](http://github.com/stucco) and we will publish our findings in academic venues.
