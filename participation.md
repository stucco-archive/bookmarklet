As a security analyst, you sift through many different data sources on a daily basis. While many of the blog posts, news feeds, and social media sources you encounter don't require your immediate attention, occasionally you encounter a piece of information that requires action.

What if a system could learn about the data sources you regularly visit and relate them to your network? Given the innumerable different data types that are currently being used, achieving such a system is a long way out. That's why we need your help.

We are collecting anonymous data that will help us tag individual pieces of security information. We reason that if a piece of information is relevant to you, then it may be relevant to another analyst. To make this possible, we have made a bookmarklet that we'd like you to click when you find any interesting security article. 

This sends the url along with a short form (and your anonymous hash) to us that we will then use to build models to automatically parse and prioritize security information.

As usual, we're making these tools [open source](http://github.com/stucco) and pending good results we hope to publish our findings in academic venues.
